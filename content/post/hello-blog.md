I've tried to start this blog at least 20 times over the past few years. Every time I'd start with all the easy stuff, the stuff I knew I was good at. I'd search for a sweet template and then painstakingly tweak all of the things about it I didn't like. I'd read blog posts about writing a blog (how meta). I'd make sure git was setup properly and I had an easy way to deploy the site to Github. Then I'd reach a sticking point, all that upfront work squandered because I didn't know what to write about. Oh yeah, and I am a chronic procrastinator.

So here I am, getting started. My hope for this blog is to serve as a living document of my journey through software development, entrepreneurship, and probably a smörgåsbord of other interesting topics that come up along the way.

So what can you expect?

Short answer is, I have no idea. Longer answer is it will probably be a collection of things that I've learned related, but not limited to, topics like vim, elixir, java, and software development best practices. My hope is that others will find at least some of these posts interesting and helpful in their own journey.

Hope you enjoy and feel free to reach out to me on Twitter, Github, or really most places on the interwebs!
